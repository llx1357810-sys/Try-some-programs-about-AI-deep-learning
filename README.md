My goal for this winter break is to learn about machine learning, from the earliest methods to the principles behind AI such as GPT. Since this is a self-taught endeavor, I might revise it after studying it in my second semester of freshman year or sophomore year, but for now, I will focus on completing my self-study attempt.
